                    <h1>In Conclusion:</h1> <!--The main title of the page-->
                    <!--The following paragraphs is for the conclusion of the statistical report-->
                    <p>
                        To conclude this statistical analysis report, we can say that in terms of the economic
                        value of trade, North America contributed the most. In terms of the weight of the pharmaceutical
                        products, Europes trades have proven to be the heaviest. Africa had the least contributions to
                        the trade, be it through its economic value or its weight. Our analysis gives us reason to believe
                        that the weight of the product being traded does not always have a correlation with the
                        economic value of the product, but instead the economic value is correlated with the type and
                        quality of the product itself. This is clearly shown by the values in kilograms and USD presented
                        by Europe and North America, because as stated, North America had the highest economic
                        value in trade of pharmaceutical products despite the weight of their products being less than
                        the weight of products of a continent like Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While analyzing the data, we found that all of the continents trade values had decreased
                        during 2020. From this, we inferred that a possible cause to this decrease was the Covid-19
                        virus. This is because when Covid-19 hit the world, in order to protect the public from the virus,
                        countries began isolating their citizens. Due to the isolation of the countries own citizens,
                        countries ended up distancing themselves and closing their doors to other countries too, which
                        meant that trade would be slightly difficult to do, therefore causing the decrease of trade.
                        Though there was still trade because despite the circumstances, trade was and is still an
                        important thing in our world, especially global trade.
