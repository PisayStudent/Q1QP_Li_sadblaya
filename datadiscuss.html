                    <h1>Discussion:</h1> <!--The main title of the page-->
                    <!--The following paragraphs are the discussion of data and interpretation of the information presented in the images (Organized by how the
                    images were presented).-->
                    <p>
                        From the 2 histograms, we can see that it is positively skewed (skewed to the right). From this, we can infer that
                        majority of the trades had values of weight and economic value in the minimum range of values for both trade and
                        weight. These range of values were $179.00 - $110,237,992.00 for trade, and 4kg - 592,734kg for weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the bar graph, we can infer the bar graph about trade, that the cost of North Americas pharmaceutical products had
                        been quite pricey compared to the rest of the continents and from the bar graph about the weight of the trade, 
                        that Europes pharmaceutical products, especially during 2018, had been quite heavy. But South America and Africa 
                        had the most consistent value of weight over the course of 3 years. From the pie charts, we can infer that from 2018 -
                        2020, North America had the highest economic value in terms of trade of pharmaceutical products, while Europes trade
                        contributed the most of the total weight of trades from 2018 - 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The relative frequency tables on this page give the percentages for the pie chart, which has already been discussed.
                        For the descriptive statistics, specifically for trade, we can interpret that the average economic value from 2018 - 
                        2020 was 90,675,034.96. But due to the data set being skewed to the right, the best measure of center to use is median, 
                        which was 7,569,117. The median encapsulates the average number of the majority of the trades when ignoring the multiple 
                        outliers. The standard deviation for this data set encapsulates a wide range, this would be due to the value of the 
                        numerous outliers, which could be interpreted as the variation of values during those 3 years. While for trade, we can 
                        interpret that the average weight value of the pharmaceutical products from 2018 - 2020 was 338,790.68. But due to the 
                        data set being skewed to the right, the best measure of center to use is median, which was 54,605. The median encapsulates 
                        the average weight of the majority of the trades when ignoring the multiple outliers. The standard deviation for this data 
                        set encapsulates a wide range, this would be due to the value of the numerous outliers, which could be interpreted as the 
                        variation in weight of the pharmaceutical products during those 3 years.

                        From the 1st box and whisker plot, which is about trade, we can interpret that the middle 50% of the data is within the 
                        1,172,377 - 64,863,778 range. Also, since the median (7,569,117) is much closer to the first quartile than the third quartile, 
                        the data is positively skewed. This is shown by the skewness (3.7) which describes an extreme positive skewness, which gives a 
                        reason for the outliers. From the 2nd box and whisker plot, which is about weight, we can interpret that the middle 50% of the 
                        data is within the 12,344.5 - 277,376.25 range. Also, since the median (54,605) is much closer to the first quartile than the 
                        third quartile, the data is positively skewed. This is shown by the skewness (5.18) which describes an extreme positive skewness, 
                        which also gives a reason for the outliers.
